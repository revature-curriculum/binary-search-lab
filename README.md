# Lab Instructions

Here we will be constructing our own binary search
. 
Use the `search()` method given to you and fill in your logic for a **Binary Search**. 

Your parameters for this method will be `int [] A`, which represents the array given, and `int N`, which represents the value of an index within the array.

Your method should return one of the following scenarios:
- If the element exists, return the **index** of the element.
- If the element does **not** exist, return **-1**.

`input -> [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 72], -4`
`output -> 1`

`input -> [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 72], 36`
`output -> "The element does not exist in the array"`

*Be sure to be mindful of the array indices as `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions` are very common.*
