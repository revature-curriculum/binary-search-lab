# Lab Instructions

Here we will be constructing our own binary search
. 
Create a search() method using your logic for a binary tree.
The method will be provided an **sorted** array of integers and an element to search for in the array as parameters. 
What should be returned is:
- If the element exists in the array, return the index of the element.
- If the element does not exist, return -1.

`input -> -4, [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 72]`
`output -> "The element may be found at index 1"`

`input -> 36, [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 72]`
`output -> "The element does not exist in the array"`

Be sure to be mindful of the array indices as `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionsare` very common.
